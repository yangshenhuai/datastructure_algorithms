 *
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
 *
 * The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
 *
 * The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
